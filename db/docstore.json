PAYMENTS, TAXES AND REFUNDS\nYou can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a\n\u201cTransaction.\u201d By each Transaction you acquire a license to use the Content only. Each Transaction is an\nelectronic contract between you and Apple, and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our\nServices. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd. or Apple Services Pte.\nLtd., then that entity is the merchant of record for some Content you acquire from Apple Books, Apple\nPodcasts, or App Store as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the\nrelevant Service. In such case, you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd. or Apple\nServices Pte. Ltd., as applicable, which is licensed by the Content provider (e.g., App Provider (as defined\nbelow), book publisher, etc.). When you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to choose how\nfrequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions. On applicable Apple hardware, if you\nenable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and\nif you enable Face ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facial\nrecognition. Manage your password settings at any time by following these instructions:\nhttps://support.apple.com/HT204030.\u00a0\nApple will charge your selected payment method for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes.\nIf you have also added it to your Apple Wallet, Apple may charge your selected payment method in Apple\nWallet using Apple Pay. You can associate multiple payment methods with your Apple Account, and you\nagree that Apple may store and charge those payment methods for Transactions. Your primary payment\nmethod appears at the top of your account settings payments page.\u00a0\nIf your primary payment method cannot be charged for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient\nfunds), you authorize Apple to attempt to charge your other eligible payment methods in order from top to\nbottom as they appear on your account settings payments page. If we cannot charge you, you remain\nresponsible for any uncollected amounts, and we may attempt to charge you again or request that you\nprovide another payment method. If you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is\ndelivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content\u02bcs availability). In accordance with local law, Apple\nmay automatically update your payment information regarding your payment methods if provided such\ninformation by the payment networks or your financial institutions. Terms related to store credit and gift\ncards/codes are available here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards.

Content prices may change at any\ntime. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole\nremedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple. From\ntime to time, Apple may suspend or cancel payment or refuse a refund request if we find evidence of\nfraud, abuse, or unlawful or other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding\ncounterclaim.\u00a0\nRight of cancellation: If you choose to cancel your order, you may do so within fourteen (14) days of when\nyou received your receipt, without giving any reason.\nTo cancel your order, you must inform us of your decision.

The Organizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay\nfor all Transactions initiated by Family members. The Organizer\u02bcs eligible payment methods are used to\npay for any Transaction initiated by a Family member (except when the Family member\u02bcs account has store\ncredit, which is always used first). Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the\nOrganizer\u02bcs eligible payment methods are used. The Organizer hereby agrees: (1) to pay for such\nTransactions; (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members are authorized; and (3) Transactions will\nbe charged to eligible payment methods in the manner indicated in Section B above. Organizers are\nresponsible for complying with their payment method contracts, and assume all risk related to sharing\naccess to their eligible payment methods with Family members.

If Ask to Buy is turned off after the Family\nmember turns eighteen (18) years old (or reaches the age of majority in their Home Country), it cannot be\nturned on anymore. Ask to Buy does not require Purchase Sharing to be enabled.\nFamily Member changes: When a Family member leaves or is removed from the Family, the remaining\nFamily members may no longer be able to access the former member\u02bcs Content, including Content\nacquired with the Organizer\u02bcs payment method.\nFamily Sharing Rules: You can only belong to one (1) Family at a time, and may join any Family no more\nthan twice per year.
